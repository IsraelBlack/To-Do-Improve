# To-do Improve

## This Foundation Branch contains the original that I am building Upon

#### Goals:
The goal of this small project is to take a very simple, basic to-do list and add features to practice my front-end development skills.
The original to-do tutorial was from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wiWzu_tRB0.

#### Features Being added
1. Tidying up existing interface
2. A check box for completed Tasks
3. Change CSS Framework
4. Add a list of completed Tasks

#### Completed Goal
As this is a practice and learning project, I will likely not have a fully developed T0-DO website, but I can add more features as I further my learning
